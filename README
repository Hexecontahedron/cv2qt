# cv2qt
Simple C++ functions to convert image matrix array from _OpenCV_'s MAT type to _Qt_'s QImage type.

### Requirements
I used version v2.4.5 of openCV, and QT v4.5, but might work on other versions.
### Usage
Library can just be added to working directory and included in project.

Currently runs only with RGB matrix arrays.
